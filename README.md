# Photobooth
Photobooth with a Raspberry Pi. Two configurations are available: 1) Use of the Raspberry Pi camera, or 2) Use of a DSLR camera.

To use the DSLR configuration you need the gphoto2 lib for python, see https://github.com/jim-easterbrook/python-gphoto2 for installation details (you also need to install the dependencies!).
